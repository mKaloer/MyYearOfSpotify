My Year in Spotify
==================

# Datasets
In order to run the code, it is required to download a number of datasets.

## Personal Spotify History
Download your personal spotify history into the `data/MyData` directory. The data can be downloaded from your Spotify profile on the Spotify website.

## Spotify Million Playlist Dataset
Download the [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge) into the `data/mpd.v1` directory.

## MusixMatch dataset
Download the [MusixMatch dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch/) to the `data/lyrics` directory.

# Run the notebook
After the datasets have been downloaded to the aforementioned directories, the notebook should be run from the root of the repository.

During the execution, it will ask for API credentials to Spotify and MusixMatch. These are personal and can be created from the two websites, respectively.
